"""WebSocket peripheral API.

Bridges LVA state to a separate peripheral container (LEDs, buttons, HAT boards).

Protocol (JSON over WebSocket):
  Events  (LVA → peripheral): {"event": "<name>", "data": {...}}
  Commands (peripheral → LVA): {"command": "<name>", "data": {...}}
  Snapshot (on connect):       {"event": "snapshot", "data": {...}}

Feedback events emitted by LVA
-------------------------------
  wake_word_detected
  listening
  stt_text        data: {"text": str}
              Emitted when HA returns the recognised speech transcript.
              Use this to display what the user said on a screen or LED ticker.
  thinking
  tts_text        data: {"text": str}
              Emitted when HA returns the assistant's response text, just
              before TTS audio begins playing.
              Use this to display the assistant's reply on a screen.
  tts_speaking
  tts_finished
  pipeline_error  data: {"reason": <str>}
              Emitted when the voice pipeline reports an error (STT failure,
              intent error, etc.). NOT emitted when HA disconnects — that
              uses the separate ``disconnected`` event below.
              Peripheral containers should show a brief red error animation
              (e.g. 3 red flashes then off) and then return to idle.
  disconnected
              Emitted when the HA TCP connection is lost.
              Connected leds with peripheral containers should
              show a red twinkle / "no connection" animation and keep retrying
              until they see a ``zeroconf`` event with status "connected".
              NOTE: if LVA itself is not running the peripheral container will
              see a WebSocket connection failure on its end — that is also
              a "disconnected" condition to handle with the same animation.
  idle
  muted                 data: {"muted": true/false}
  timer_ticking   data: {"id": str, "name": str, "total_seconds": int, "seconds_left": int}
  timer_updated   data: {"id": str, "name": str, "total_seconds": int, "seconds_left": int}
  timer_ringing   data: {"id": str, "name": str, "total_seconds": int, "seconds_left": int}
  media_player_playing  Emitted when HA sends music/media to the music_player
                        (non-announcement playback). Not emitted for TTS or
                        voice pipeline announcements — those use tts_speaking.
  volume_changed        data: {"volume": 0.0–1.0}
  volume_muted          data: {"muted": true/false}
  zeroconf              data: {"status": "getting_started" | "connected"}
  light_command         data: {"object_id": str, "state": bool, "brightness": float,
                              "red": float, "green": float, "blue": float, "effect": str}
              Fires when HA changes a Light entity that a peripheral
              previously registered via register_light. The peripheral
              matches on object_id and applies the new state. The
              effect names are those the peripheral declared at
              registration; e.g. "Voice Assistant" runs the pipeline
              animations.
  button_lock_changed   data: {"locked": bool}
              Fires when the user toggles the "Disable button controls"
              switch on the Home Assistant device page for a peripheral
              that registered it via register_button_lock. The current
              value is also included as "button_controls_locked" in the
              snapshot payload for newly-connecting/reconnecting clients.
              A peripheral should stop executing button-triggered LVA
              commands (start_listening, stop_pipeline, mute_mic/
              unmute_mic, volume_up/down, button_*_press, etc.) while
              locked is true.

Commands accepted from the peripheral container
------------------------------------------------
  start_listening
  stop_pipeline     Abort the active voice pipeline at any phase — listening,
                    thinking, speaking or wake word active. Calls satellite.stop() which
                    cleans up STT streaming, sends VoiceAssistantAnnounceFinished
                    to HA, unducking music, and emits idle to peripherals.
  mute_mic
  unmute_mic
  volume_up
  volume_down
  set_volume        data: {"volume": 0.0–1.0}
  stop_timer_ringing
  pause_media_player
  resume_media_player
  stop_media_player
  button_single_press
  button_double_press
  button_triple_press
  button_long_press
  register_light    data: {"name": str, "object_id": str, "effects": [str],
                           "supports_rgb": bool, "supports_brightness": bool}
              The peripheral declares an LED Light it wants exposed in
              HA. LVA creates a matching ESPHome Light entity (visible
              as light.<satellite>_<object_id>) and routes HA changes
              back to the peripheral as light_command events. Send
              once after connecting; duplicate registrations for the
              same object_id are ignored.
  register_button
              The peripheral declares that it has physical buttons and
              wants a Button Press event entity exposed in HA. LVA
              creates a ButtonEventSensorEntity (visible as
              event.<satellite>_button_press_event) that fires
              single_press, double_press, triple_press, and long_press
              events to Home Assistant when the corresponding
              button_* commands are sent. Send once after connecting;
              duplicate registrations are ignored.
  register_button_lock
              The peripheral declares that it has on-board buttons whose
              behavior can be toggled from Home Assistant. LVA creates a
              "Disable button controls" switch entity (visible as
              switch.<satellite>_disable_button_controls, disabled/off
              by default) and routes HA changes back to the peripheral
              as button_lock_changed events. The peripheral is
              responsible for honoring the lock state — LVA does not
              gate anything on its end. Send once after connecting;
              duplicate registrations are ignored and preserve the
              current lock state.
