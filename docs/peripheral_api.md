# Peripheral WebSocket API

Linux Voice Assistant exposes a WebSocket API on port 6055 that lets external scripts and containers integrate with LVA in real time. This is how LED rings, button boards, displays, and other peripherals communicate with the voice assistant without modifying LVA itself.

The peripheral API is what allows hardware like the Satellite1 HAT Board or the ReSpeaker series to light up when you say the wake word, show a thinking animation while the assistant processes your request, and let physical buttons start a conversation or dismiss a timer — all from a completely separate process or container.

---

## How it works

LVA acts as the WebSocket **server**. Your peripheral script or container connects as a **client**. Once connected, LVA immediately sends a snapshot of its current state, and from that point on all communication is bidirectional:

- **Events** flow from LVA to your client, describing what the assistant is doing right now (listening, thinking, speaking, etc.).
- **Commands** flow from your client to LVA, telling it what to do (start listening, adjust volume, fire a button press event to Home Assistant, etc.).

All messages are JSON objects sent over a plain WebSocket connection. No authentication is required.

**This matters because of the default bind address.** LVA binds the peripheral
API to `0.0.0.0` by default, meaning any device on the same network — not
just this machine — can connect to it. Combined with the lack of
authentication, that means anyone on the LAN can mute/unmute the mic, start a
voice pipeline (which sends captured audio to whatever conversation agent is
configured), change the volume, or register arbitrary entities into Home
Assistant. If you don't need to control LVA from another device or
container on the network, start it with `--peripheral-host 127.0.0.1` so the
API only accepts connections from this machine. LVA logs a warning at
startup whenever it binds to a non-loopback address.

```

        │──── command: volume_up ─────────►│   (user pressed a button)
        │──── command: start_listening ───►│   (user pressed action button)
```

### Connection

```
ws://<lva-host>:6055
```

By default LVA binds to `0.0.0.0:6055`. You can change the host and port with `--peripheral-host` and `--peripheral-port`, or disable the API entirely with `--disable-peripheral-api`.

### Message format

Events from LVA:
```json
{"event": "<event_name>", "data": {"key": "value"}}
```

Commands to LVA:
```json
{"command": "<command_name>", "data": {"key": "value"}}
```

The `data` field is omitted when there is no payload.

### Snapshot on connect

Immediately after connecting, LVA sends a snapshot so your client can synchronise its state without waiting for the next event:

```json
{
  "event": "snapshot",
  "data": {
    "muted": false,
    "volume": 0.8,
    "ha_connected": true,
    "button_controls_disabled": false,
    "last_stt_text": "set a timer for five minutes",
    "last_tts_text": "Sure, I've set a timer for five minutes."
  }
}
```

`last_stt_text` and `last_tts_text` are the most recent conversation exchange, or `null` if no conversation has happened yet since startup. Both are cleared when a new pipeline run starts.

## Python quick-start

```python
import asyncio
import json
import websockets

async def main():
    async with websockets.connect("ws://localhost:6055") as ws:
        async for raw in ws:
            msg = json.loads(raw)
            event = msg.get("event")
            data  = msg.get("data", {})
            print(f"Event: {event}  data={data}")

            # Example: send a command in response to an event
            if event == "idle":
                await ws.send(json.dumps({"command": "volume_up"}))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Events (LVA → your script)

These are all the events LVA emits. Your peripheral script receives them and reacts — for example by changing LED colours, updating a display, or playing a sound.

### Voice pipeline events

| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `wake_word_detected` | — | The configured wake word was detected. The wakeup chime is now playing. Start your "wake" animation here. |
| `listening` | — | The wakeup chime has finished and LVA is now streaming audio to Home Assistant for speech-to-text. Show a "listening" animation. |
| `stt_text` | `{"text": str}` | Home Assistant returned the recognised speech transcript. Use this to show what the user said on a display or LED ticker. |
| `thinking` | — | LVA has stopped streaming audio and Home Assistant is processing the intent. Show a "thinking" animation. |
| `tts_text` | `{"text": str}` | Home Assistant returned the assistant's text response, just before TTS audio begins playing. Use this to display the reply on a screen. |
| `tts_speaking` | — | The TTS audio response is now playing. Show a "speaking" animation. |
| `tts_finished` | — | TTS playback has finished. Transition back to idle, unless a new pipeline run is about to start. |
| `idle` | — | The assistant is idle and ready for the next wake word. Turn off active animations. |

### Error and connection events

| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `pipeline_error` | `{"reason": str}` | The voice pipeline failed — for example STT failure or an intent error. Show a brief red error animation (3 flashes, then off). NOT emitted when HA disconnects; see `disconnected` below. |
| `disconnected` | — | The TCP connection to Home Assistant was lost. Show a "no connection" animation and keep it until you see `zeroconf` with `status: connected`. Note: if LVA itself is not running, your client will see a WebSocket connection failure instead — treat that the same way. |
| `muted` | `{"muted": bool}` | The microphone mute state changed. `true` = muted (show a muted indicator on your LEDs, e.g. red at mic positions), `false` = unmuted. Emitted on every transition in both directions, so peripherals can track mute state without inferring it from `idle`. |
| `zeroconf` | `{"status": "getting_started" \| "connected"}` | Reports LVA's connection lifecycle. `getting_started` is emitted at startup before HA connects; `connected` is emitted once the HA TCP handshake completes. Use `connected` to clear a "no connection" animation. |
| `button_controls_disabled` | `{"disabled": bool}` | Reflects the "Disable button controls" switch on the Home Assistant device page. `true` = on-board buttons should be ignored by the peripheral; `false` = normal button behaviour. Off by default. Also included directly in the `snapshot` payload for newly-connecting clients. |

### Timer events

| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `timer_ticking` | `{"id": str, "name": str, "total_seconds": int, "seconds_left": int}` | A timer has been set and is counting down. Show a countdown animation proportional to `seconds_left / total_seconds`. |
| `timer_updated` | `{"id": str, "name": str, "total_seconds": int, "seconds_left": int}` | A running timer was adjusted. Update your countdown display. |
| `timer_ringing` | `{"id": str, "name": str, "total_seconds": int, "seconds_left": int}` | The timer has expired and the alarm sound is playing. Show a repeating alert animation. Send `stop_timer_ringing` to dismiss. |

### Media and volume events

| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `media_player_playing` | — | HA started streaming music or media to the background music player (non-announcement). Show a "media playing" indicator. Not emitted for TTS or announcements — those use `tts_speaking`. |
| `volume_changed` | `{"volume": float}` | The speaker volume changed (0.0–1.0). Update any volume display or indicator ring. |
| `volume_muted` | `{"muted": bool}` | The media player mute state changed. Distinct from microphone mute (`muted` event). |

### HA driven entity events

These events fire when a user changes a peripheral registered HA entity from Home Assistant. Use them to apply the user's preferences to your hardware in real time.

| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `light_command` | `{"object_id": str, "state": bool, "brightness": float, "red": float, "green": float, "blue": float, "effect": str}` | An HA Light entity that a peripheral registered via `register_light` was changed. The event is broadcast to every connected peripheral, so filter on `object_id` to route it to the right hardware. `brightness` and RGB values are 0.0 to 1.0. `effect` is one of the strings declared when the Light was registered. |

---

## Commands (your script → LVA)

Send these to control LVA from your peripheral hardware.

### Entity registration

A peripheral that wants Home Assistant to control its hardware declares its entities at connect time. LVA materialises matching ESPHome entities, HA enumerates and shows them as it would any other ESPHome device, and user changes flow back as events.

For HA to see your entity, your peripheral must register before HA enumerates the LVA API. LVA waits briefly at startup (see `--peripheral-startup-wait`, default 2 seconds) so peripherals have a window to connect and register. Peripherals that connect later still work, but the new entities only appear in HA after the integration is reloaded.

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `register_light` | `{"name": str, "object_id": str, "effects": [str], "supports_rgb": bool, "supports_brightness": bool}` | Register a Light entity for an LED strip, ring, or single LED. HA exposes it as `light.<satellite>_<object_id>` with on/off, brightness, RGB, and a selectable effect from the declared list. Subsequent HA changes are delivered as `light_command` events. Send once after connecting; repeat registrations for the same `object_id` are idempotent (no-op). Example: `{"command": "register_light", "data": {"name": "LEDs", "object_id": "leds", "effects": ["Voice Assistant"], "supports_rgb": true, "supports_brightness": true}}` |
| `register_button` | `{"name": Button Press, "button_press_event": str}` | Register a Button entity for a physical button on your peripheral. When the user presses the button in HA, LVA emits a `button_press` event to all connected peripherals. Send once after connecting; repeat registrations for the same `object_id` are idempotent (no-op). Example: `{"command": "register_button"}` |
| `register_button_lock` | `{"name": Button Lock, "button_lock_event": str}` | Register a Button Lock entity for a "Disable button controls" switch on the HA device page. When the user toggles it, LVA emits a `button_lock_changed` event to all connected peripherals. Send once after connecting; repeat registrations for the same `object_id` are idempotent (no-op). Example: `{"command": "register_button_lock"}` |

### Voice pipeline

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `start_listening` | — | Play the start-listening chime and begin a voice pipeline run, as if the user pressed the action button. No-op if already muted or pipeline already active. |
| `stop_pipeline` | — | Abort the active voice pipeline at any phase (listening, thinking, or TTS speaking). Cleans up STT streaming, sends `AnnounceFinished` to HA, unducking music, and emits `idle`. |

### Microphone

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `mute_mic` | — | Mute the microphone. Stops any active pipeline, plays the mute sound, and emits `muted` with `{"muted": true}` to all clients. No-op if already muted. |
| `unmute_mic` | — | Unmute the microphone. Plays the unmute sound and emits `muted` with `{"muted": false}` followed by `idle`. No-op if already unmuted. |

### Volume

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `volume_up` | — | Increase speaker volume by one step (default 5 %, configurable with `--peripheral-volume-step`). Updates HA, persists the value, and emits `volume_changed`. |
| `volume_down` | — | Decrease speaker volume by one step. |
| `set_volume` | `{"volume": float}` | Set the speaker volume to an exact value between 0.0 and 1.0. Values outside this range are clamped. Updates HA, persists, and emits `volume_changed`. Example: `{"command": "set_volume", "data": {"volume": 0.6}}` |

### Timer

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `stop_timer_ringing` | — | Dismiss a ringing timer. Stops the alarm sound, clears the timer state, unducking music, and emits `idle`. No-op if no timer is ringing. |

### Media player

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `stop_media_player` | — | Stop background music / media playback. Updates the HA media player entity state to Idle. |
| `pause_media_player` | — | Pause background music. Updates HA state to Paused. |
| `resume_media_player` | — | Resume paused music. Updates HA state to Playing. |

### Button events (sent to Home Assistant)

These commands fire event entities on the LVA device page in Home Assistant, which you can use in automations. They are intended for any of the buttons on your hardware that are available for these multipress functions and don't handle other context-sensitive commands. **The button must be registered with `register_button` command to appear as a HA sensor and be able to send these events.**

| Command | Data | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `button_single_press` | — | Fire a `single_press` event to HA. No sound is played. |
| `button_double_press` | — | Fire a `double_press` event to HA. Plays the configured double-press sound. |
| `button_triple_press` | — | Fire a `triple_press` event to HA. Plays the configured triple-press sound. |
| `button_long_press` | — | Fire a `long_press` event to HA. Plays the configured long-press sound. |

> **Important:** `button_single_press` must be sent from a **different physical button** than the button that trigger other commands. Like the action button's single press that's reserved for triggering the voice pipeline (`start_listening` on first press, then context-sensitive commands on subsequent presses). Using the same button for both would create ambiguous behavior.

The press type is determined by your peripheral script using timing logic that matches the Home Assistant Voice PE centre button behaviour:

```
Single press  : one press, then >250 ms silence
Double press  : press → <250 ms gap → press → >250 ms silence
Triple press  : press → <250 ms gap → press → <250 ms gap → press → >250 ms silence
Long press    : button held for ≥1 s
```

Your script is responsible for detecting these patterns and sending the appropriate command. See the board-specific examples below for reference implementations.

## Minimal example script

The following self-contained script connects to LVA, prints every event with a timestamp, and maps a single GPIO button (Raspberry Pi GPIO 17) to context-sensitive commands:

## Adding your own example

Have you built a peripheral controller for a board not listed above? Contributions are very welcome. Open a pull request at [github.com/OHF-Voice/linux-voice-assistant/pulls](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/linux-voice-assistant/pulls) with:

- A folder under `examples/<Your Board Name>/`
- The controller script (Python or other language)
- A `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` so others can run it with one command
- A `DOCS.md` following the same structure as the existing examples (hardware layout, GPIO mapping, LED animations, installation steps, troubleshooting)

Please make sure your example handles reconnection gracefully (retry on WebSocket failure) and shows a "not ready" effect when LVA is not reachable or HA is disconnected.
